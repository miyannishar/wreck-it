name: wreck-explore
description: Explore a running local web app through Playwright MCP as a normal user (every core flow plus data-integrity checks) and then in character as each persona from .wreck-it/personas.md, recording reproducible bugs with wreck-it. Use as stages 4–5 of a wreck-it run, or when the user asks to "click through my app like a user", "test the happy paths", "try my app as a beginner", or "check my core flows".

# wreck-explore

Two passes:
1. **Normal-user pass**, persona `normal-user`.
2. **Persona exploration**, every other persona in `.wreck-it/personas.md` except `chaos-monkey`.

Prerequisites:
- `.wreck-it/discovery.json` exists. Otherwise run `npx wreck-it discover`.
- `.wreck-it/personas.md` exists. Otherwise use the wreck-personas skill.
- Playwright MCP browser tools are available.

Record every bug as described in the wreck-it skill's `references/recording-findings.md` (run `npx wreck-it schema finding` if that file isn't available). Note: core rules:
- `npx wreck-it finding add`
- structured steps
- role/label targets
- assertions that describe correct behavior
- replay in a fresh context before setting `reproduced: true`

## Per page, every time

After each navigation or meaningful action:
1. `browser_snapshot` to read the page. Use the role and name values it shows for targets.
2. Run the oddity script: `browser_evaluate` with the output of `npx wreck-it oddity-script` (fetch it once and reuse it).
3. Check `browser_console_messages` (errors) and `browser_network_requests` (4xx/5xx).
4. Log coverage: `npx wreck-it run visit <route> --persona <slug>`.
5. Before recording a finding, take a screenshot with `browser_take_screenshot`.

## Pass 1: normal-user (stage `normal`)

`npx wreck-it run stage normal running`

Walk every core flow as intended. Get the flows from discovery: sign-up, login, CRUD on each main entity, search, checkout, settings, logout. Use realistic test data (`wreck.tester+<n>@example.com`, password `Wreck-it-123!`). If self sign-up is impossible, use `accounts[0]` from `.wreck-it/config.json`. If neither works, ask the user for a test account.

After the flows, work through this **checklist**. Every row is required. Write it to `.wreck-it/normal-pass.md` as a table with one line per row, marking each ✓ (checked, fine), ✗ WR-NNN (bug recorded) or — (not applicable, say why). A violation is a `functional` finding unless noted.

| # | Check | How |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Created items appear in their list and detail page | Create one of each main entity, then open the list and the detail page |
| 2 | Edits persist | Edit a record and see the success message, then `reload`. Log out and back in and check again |
| 3 | Deletes disappear everywhere | After deleting or removing: lists, counts, **header badges**, search and totals all update |
| 4 | Arithmetic is right at every step | Use **quantity ≥ 2 on at least one item** and apply any discount, coupon or promo you can find. Recompute subtotal, discount and total by hand at each place they're shown: cart, checkout, confirmation, detail page, list page. Every number must match your calculation and every other page. |
| 5 | Same entity, same facts everywhere | Name, price, status and **date format** must be identical between list and detail views |
| 6 | Lists are sorted sensibly | History, orders and activity should be newest first, or have an obvious sort control. Otherwise it's `ux` |
| 7 | Fresh-account empty states | Sign up a brand-new account and open every list or collection page (orders, cart, history, dashboard) while it's empty. Expect a clear empty state with a next step. A spinner still spinning after 5 s, a blank area, or a dead end is `ux` |
| 8 | Error messages help | **In the browser UI** (not curl: the API message can be fine while the page hides it), submit each auth or settings form with one invalid field (bad email format, short password). The message should name the problem and keep the other fields filled. A generic "Something went wrong" or wiped fields is `ux` |
| 9 | Session survives | Log out, log in, and check that the data from rows 1–4 is still there |

A broken core flow is `critical` or `high`. The report surfaces these first.

`npx wreck-it run stage normal done`

## Pass 2: personas (stage `explore`)

`npx wreck-it run stage explore running`

For each persona:
1. Set the viewport with `browser_resize` to the persona's device.
2. If the persona's network is slow or flaky, note it. Chaos owns network faults; here, just be impatient the way the persona would be.
3. Work through the persona's missions **in character**:
   - **ICP personas:** pursue the goal efficiently and notice anything that would make them churn.
   - **rushed-beginner:** skip instructions, double-click submit buttons (`click` with `count: 2`), use wrong formats (`12/31/24` vs `2024-12-31`, `$1,000` in a number field, phone numbers with spaces), leave fields empty, press back mid-flow, abandon a flow and come back, and add trailing spaces.
4. **Time budget:** about 15 actions per mission. If the persona can't finish a mission within budget, or can't tell what to do next, that is a `ux` finding. Record what blocked them in `actual`.
5. Record bugs with `"persona": "<slug>"`.

### Claude Code parallel mode

When the `wreck-persona` subagent and the `wreck-browser-1..3` MCP servers are available, the orchestrator dispatches one subagent per persona, up to 3 at a time. Each subagent:
- gets the persona block and the base URL
- follows only this section, with its own browser
- records findings directly (the CLI handles concurrent `finding add` safely)

`npx wreck-it run stage explore done`

## Auth state

After logging in once, keep the browser session for later missions. Don't sign up again for every mission. If the session expires unexpectedly mid-flow, that's a finding: `functional`, medium.

## What not to record

- Intended validation behaving correctly. For example, "email required" shown for an empty email is correct.
- Bugs that need production data or third-party services that aren't configured locally. Mention these in your final summary instead.
